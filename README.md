Purpose: the purpose of this project is to create an Uzbek programming language that is targeted for Uzbek native speakers. 
Uzbek programming language aims to remove the language barrier to allow more Uzbek native speakers to learn how to code. 
Uzbekistan is an underrepresented area in the tech field. 


Summary:
Throughout the second end of the semester, Sam and Madina have been working on creating Uzbek Programming Language using the available resources.
We faced many challenges and barriers, however, we learned a lot throughout the project.
